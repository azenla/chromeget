# ChromeGet

Chrome OS Package Manager

## Why?

Chrome OS is increasingly popular, and a lot of times, to develop Chrome Apps and Extensions, you just need Native Tools.

ChromeGet will fulfill that need by enabling Chrome OS to have native apps with little effort required.

## Installation

*WARNING* As of right now, I do not have an automated installer. The current expectation is that you already have node.js installed.

Execute the following commands:
```bash
cd /home/chronos/user/
curl https://github.com/kaendfinger/chromeget/archive/master.tar.gz | tar zxvf
cd chromeget-master
npm install
npm 
```
